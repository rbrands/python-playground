    "# Working with Azure Blob Storage and Machine Learning\n",
    "## Wine Quality Prediction Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to integrate **Azure Blob Storage** into a typical data science workflow. We'll build a complete pipeline from data storage to machine learning predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll learn:**\n",
    "- Connect to Azure Blob Storage from Python\n",
    "- Create containers and upload datasets\n",
    "- Download and process data from the cloud\n",
    "- Build a regression model (predicting continuous values)\n",
    "- Store results and models back to Azure\n",
    "- Best practices for cloud data management\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Azure Blob Storage?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits for Data Scientists:**\n",
    "- 📦 Store large datasets (GB/TB) without cluttering Git repositories\n",
    "- 🔄 Share data easily across team members\n",
    "- 💰 Cost-effective storage (pay only for what you use)\n",
    "- 🌍 Access data from anywhere (local, Codespace, Azure ML)\n",
    "- 📊 Separate data from code (better organization)\n",
    "- 🔐 Secure with access controls and encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:**\n",
    "- Raw datasets too large for Git (> 100 MB)\n",
    "- Processed data and feature engineering results\n",
    "- Trained models and model artifacts\n",
    "- Experiment results and predictions\n",
    "- Shared datasets for team collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset: Wine Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the **Wine Quality Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Details:**\n",
    "- Source: Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wines\n",
    "- Samples: ~6,500 wines (red and white variants)\n",
    "- Features: 11 physicochemical properties\n",
    "  - Fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid\n",
    "  - Residual sugar, chlorides\n",
    "  - Free and total sulfur dioxide\n",
    "  - Density, pH\n",
    "  - Sulphates, alcohol content\n",
    "- Target: Quality score (0-10, based on sensory data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**ML Task:** **Regression** (predicting a continuous quality score)\n",
    "- This is different from Iris (classification with categories)\n",
    "- We'll predict numeric values instead of classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Azure Storage Account (created: `rbrandsdataplayground`)\n",
    "- Connection String (stored as Codespace Secret)\n",
    "- Python packages: `azure-storage-blob`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Structure:**\n",
    "1. Setup & Connection to Azure Blob Storage\n",
    "2. Create Container & Upload Dataset\n",
    "3. Download & Explore Data\n",
    "4. Data Analysis & Visualization\n",
    "5. Machine Learning - Regression Model\n",
    "6. Save Results & Model to Blob Storage\n",
    "7. Best Practices & Cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started! 🚀"
